** GitOps CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD

Overview of Objectives:

1. Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow using GitHub Actions to perform testing, security scanning, and Docker image publishing.

2. Establish a GitOps-driven Continuous Deployment (CD) process with ArgoCD to enable automated syncing and application deployment.

3. Securely manage sensitive data by leveraging GitHub Secrets for credential handling.

4. Achieve seamless, zero-downtime deployments through ArgoCDâ€™s auto-sync and self-healing capabilities.


** To use Argo CD, we need a Kubernetes cluster, kubectl configured to interact with it, and a Git repository containing your application manifests. **

You also need to install Argo CD itself, either using Helm, Kustomize, or plain-YAML manifests. 



4. Argo CD Installation:

Method 1: Helm: 
    Use Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, to install Argo CD. This is a common and recommended approach. 

Method 2: Kustomize: 
    Use Kustomize, a configuration management tool, to customize and deploy Argo CD. 

Method 3: Plain YAML manifests: 
    Apply the official Argo CD manifests directly to your cluster. 

5. Accessing the Argo CD UI:

   To access the Argo CD dashboard, you may need to forward the Argo CD server port using kubectl port-forward.
   The default port is 443, but it might be exposed as 8080 when using port-forward. 

6. Registering a Cluster :
   If you want to deploy applications to external clusters, you'll need to register those clusters with Argo CD.
   This involves providing the cluster's credentials to Argo CD. 

7. Understanding GitOps:

   Argo CD is based on the GitOps paradigm, where changes to your application are made by updating the application's manifests in a Git repository.
   Argo CD then automatically detects these changes and applies them to your Kubernetes cluster.
