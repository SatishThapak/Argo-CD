üõ†Ô∏è Technologies/Tools Needed

1. GitHub Actions
2. Argo CD
3. Git
4. Docker
5. Kubernetes

## Core Concepts and Terminology

1. Repository: A Git repository that contains the application and infrastructure configurations.
2. Applications: The applications that run on the infrastructure.
3. Infrastructure: The underlying resources that support the applications.
4. GitOps: The automation-first approach to managing infrastructure and applications using Git as the single source of truth.

## How It Works

1. GitHub Actions: A CI/CD platform that automates workflows such as testing, building Docker images, and pushing updates to your manifests.
2. Argo CD: A declarative GitOps tool for Kubernetes that continuously syncs application state from Git and automates rollbacks on failure.
3. Git: Acts as the version-controlled source of truth for both application and infrastructure configurations.
4. Docker: Used to containerize applications, making them portable and consistent across environments.
5. Kubernetes: Orchestrates and manages the containerized infrastructure and applications.


## Best Practices

1. Separate Repositories: Maintain separate Git repositories for infrastructure and application manifests to isolate concerns and enhance maintainability.
2. Branching Strategies: Use consistent Git branching practices (e.g., feature branches, pull requests) to manage changes in a controlled manner.
3. Rollback Mechanisms: Leverage Argo CD's automated rollback features to quickly revert failed deployments and maintain system stability.
