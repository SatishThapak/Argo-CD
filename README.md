Argo CD
📌 What Is Argo CD?

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. As a Kubernetes-native CD solution, it stands apart from traditional push-based tools by supporting pull-based deployments: Argo CD continuously monitors Git repositories and deploys updates directly to Kubernetes clusters.

This approach empowers teams to manage both infrastructure configuration and application updates from a single, centralized, version-controlled system.

✨ Key Features
🔁 Manual or automatic deployment of applications to Kubernetes.

🔄 Auto-syncing live cluster state with Git-defined desired state.

🖥️ Web UI and CLI for app visualization and management.

🧠 Detection and correction of configuration drift.

🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure multi-cluster management.
