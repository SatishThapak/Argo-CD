What Is Argo CD?

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

Argo CD is a Kubernetes-native continuous deployment (CD) tool. Unlike external CD tools that only enable push-based deployments, Argo CD can pull updated code from Git repositories and deploy it directly to Kubernetes resources. 
It enables developers to manage both infrastructure configuration and application updates in one system


Argo CD key features:

Manual or automatic deployment of applications to a Kubernetes cluster.
Automatic synchronization of application state to the current version of declarative configuration.
Web user interface and command-line interface (CLI).
Ability to visualize deployment issues, detect and remediate configuration drift.
Role-based access control (RBAC) enabling multi-cluster management.
Single sign-on (SSO) with providers such as GitLab, GitHub, Microsoft, OAuth2, OIDC, LinkedIn, LDAP, and SAML 2.0
Support for webhooks triggering actions in GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket.


Why Argo CD?

Application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative and version controlled. 
Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.
