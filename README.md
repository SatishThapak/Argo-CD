ðŸ“Œ What Is Argo CD?

ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. 
It follows the GitOps paradigm, where the desired state of your application is defined in Git, and ArgoCD ensures that your Kubernetes cluster matches this desired state

This approach empowers teams to manage both infrastructure configuration and application updates from a single, centralized, version-controlled system.

âœ¨ Key Features

1. Manual or automatic deployment of applications to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Automatic synchronization of application state to the current version of declarative configuration.
3. Web user interface and command-line interface (CLI).
4. Ability to visualize deployment issues, detect and remediate configuration drift.
5. Role-based access control (RBAC) enabling multi-cluster management.
6. Single sign-on (SSO) with providers such as GitLab, GitHub, Microsoft, OAuth2,  OIDC, LinkedIn, LDAP, and SAML 2.0
7. Support for webhooks triggering actions in GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket.
