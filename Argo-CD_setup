To use Argo CD, we need a Kubernetes cluster, kubectl configured to interact with it, and a Git repository containing your application manifests. 
You also need to install Argo CD itself, either using Helm, Kustomize, or plain-YAML manifests. 

Here's a more detailed:

1. Kubernetes Cluster:
Argo CD is designed to manage deployments on Kubernetes, so you need a running Kubernetes cluster. This could be a local cluster like Minikube or K3s, or a cloud-based cluster like those offered by GKE, AKS, or EKS.

You'll need to be able to interact with the cluster using kubectl. 

2. kubectl:

kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster.
Make sure kubectl is installed and configured to connect to your cluster. 

3. Git Repository:

Argo CD is a GitOps tool, meaning it uses Git repositories as the source of truth for your application's desired state. 
You need a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) that contains your Kubernetes manifests (e.g., deployments, services, etc.)

4. Argo CD Installation:

Method 1: Helm: Use Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, to install Argo CD. This is a common and recommended approach. 
Method 2: Kustomize: Use Kustomize, a configuration management tool, to customize and deploy Argo CD. 
Method 3: Plain YAML manifests: Apply the official Argo CD manifests directly to your cluster. 

5. Accessing the Argo CD UI (Optional):

To access the Argo CD dashboard, you may need to forward the Argo CD server port using kubectl port-forward.
The default port is 443, but it might be exposed as 8080 when using port-forward. 

6. Registering a Cluster (Optional):
If you want to deploy applications to external clusters, you'll need to register those clusters with Argo CD.
This involves providing the cluster's credentials to Argo CD. 

7. Understanding GitOps:

Argo CD is based on the GitOps paradigm, where changes to your application are made by updating the application's manifests in a Git repository.
Argo CD then automatically detects these changes and applies them to your Kubernetes cluster. 

8. Argo CD CLI (Optional):
The Argo CD CLI (command-line interface) provides a way to interact with Argo CD from your terminal.
You can download the latest Argo CD CLI version from the official releases page.
